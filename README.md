Repository for a solution to the Kaggle's M5 Forecasting Competition using LightGBM. For full detail of the competion please see https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy

## Competition Background

  Forecasts are indispensable for many of the daily decisions that we make, such as time to get up in the morning in order to not be late for work, or when is the best time to fill up the tank before the gas price goes up. Supermarkets require forecasts to support their strategic development, make tactical decisions, and manage their demand and supply planning processes to avoid customer service issues and high inventory costs (Fildes et al., 2019). Therefore, it is important for supermarkets like Walmart to forecast as accurately as possible because stocking too many products incurs extra costs, whereas stocking insufficient would lead to lost sales and low profits. The M competitions have been conducted for almost 40 years. They aim to identify ways to improve forecasting accuracy by empirically evaluating several methods and identifying the one with the best accuracy. The findings obtained in these competitions have significantly influenced the theory and practice of forecasting by providing valuable insights into how forecasting accuracy can be improved (Hyndman, 2020).
 
  The M5 competition extended the objectives of the previous four competitions by focusing on a retail sales forecasting application and using real-life, hierarchically structured sales data with intermittent and erratic characteristics (Syntetos and Boylan, 2005, Syntetos et al., 2005). The competition attracted many eager participants to experiment with effective forecasting solutions in real-life situations faced by numerous retail companies on a daily basis. 

## Competition Objective
  The objective of the M5 “Accuracy” competition is to forecast Walmart's daily sales in 10 stores from 3 states for the next 28 days (4 weeks ahead) for each 42,840 units.
